  <p>Welcome to my personal website. <a href="/site">Read</a> about it.</p>
  <h2>A quick about me</h2>
  <p>
    In the past I've been a coffee roaster, beverage industry entreprenuer, and e-commerce entreprenuer. The most
    successful was e-commerce which made a few million in annual sales. Now I'm a computer programmer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love single tasking and testing the extremes.
    When I decided to be a programmer, I went from knowing little about programming to working at Microsoft in less than
    a year.

  <p>From Southern California, currently live in Seattle, Washington.</p>
