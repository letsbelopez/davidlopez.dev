  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my hand built personal website. <a href="/site">Read</a> about how I made it.</p>
  <p>
    In the past I've been a coffee roaster, beverage industry entreprenuer, and e-commerce entreprenuer. The most
    successful was my e-commerce website which made a few million in annual sales.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now I'm a software developer. I'm self taught. I
    started programming because I wanted an e-commerce website to make money online.
    When I moved on from e-commerce, I decided to go deep into programming. I signed up for classes at
    <a href="https://sabio.la/">Sabio</a>, and 11 months later, I was a software engineer at Microsoft.
