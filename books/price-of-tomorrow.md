Deflation, put simply, is when you get more for your money—just as inflation is when you get less for your money.

The problem is that we still think that deflation is restricted to parts of our economy—that we will keep getting more with less in our electronic devices while getting the benefits of inflation in the rest of our lives. And we still look at technology through a narrow lens, as if it’s only something that powers our phones.

if you’re not a technology-based company, you will likely not be a company at all.

So, if technology is making its way into every industry, why should we expect to get the benefit of the deflationary force in some places but inflation everywhere else?

Debt combined with deflation is a toxic combination, because borrowers have to pay the same for their interest payments while earning less.

Understanding this balance and making informed decisions is important because we all live in the same world; each side of a relationship affects the other. A growing consumer class in China could very well help lift world economies, but for that to happen, Chinese workers will need to be paid more. And if American workers want to sell to China, they’ll have to earn less. I’m sure that many people in the US who are frustrated with China’s role as producer would not accept the 996 work weeks (9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days per week) for average wages of $1,400 per month that many of their Chinese counterparts have.

When economies and high-paying jobs are at risk, though, the easiest thing to do in politics is to blame outsiders or game the situation to provide short-term benefit—and kick the can down the road.

We fool ourselves into believing that assets, such as stocks or housing, always go up over the long term because they always have. We should ask whether those same assets would have gone up over the last twenty years if there hadn’t been $185 trillion of new capital injected into economies over that time. When that stops, which it eventually will, things will change very quickly.

For those unable to access debt, though, and put it into assets that rose in value, the inflation has been punishing because their dollars do not go as far as they used to.

And since inflation makes your currency worth less over time, we need to start asking: Isn’t currency founded on trust in the value of that currency? And doesn’t that mean that by setting inflation target rates, governments have a stated goal of eroding that trust?

quantitative easing also causes currency devaluation, even if that’s not what it’s specifically intended to do. The government doesn’t actually have more assets; it’s just representing its assets with more units of currency, which means each unit of currency is worth less—like cutting a pizza into twelve slices instead of eight.

A country that devalues its currency also indirectly lowers its labour rate against global competitors, which can help some job growth in the short term, because its goods cost less to buyers in other countries.

If we’re being honest with ourselves, much of the wealth and privilege that we enjoy is not from our ingenuity or hard work, but because the governments of the world decided to print money.

timing stood out above all in determining success rates of startups. In fact, 42 percent of the success could be attributed to timing.

Being early on a platform can yield terrific results for supply. A hack I used on Twitter gives a good example. Realizing the pattern—that supply was needed for the platform owners and being early mattered—I decided to write a blog post in early 2008 titled “Why Every CEO Needs to Be on Twitter.” In this case, I was a supplier (a CEO) that validated the platform for other CEOs. Two days later, something extraordinary happened: after using the service for months before that with limited interactions, my Twitter account exploded—gaining over 1,000 followers a day. It took some time to figure out what had happened. Then a friend sent me a screenshot of his Twitter onboarding process: there was a list of ten CEOs that every new Twitter member should follow. There I was—the only one of the ten that didn’t belong on the list. Right between Richard Branson and Bill Gates. As I gained more followers, the rate increased as my number of followers itself convinced others I was worth following. That one blog post and the subsequent actions by Twitter drove my followers to more than 185,000 almost overnight.

But the pattern then repeated itself, now on paid results, as competitors raced in. The 5 cents rose to over $5.00. Through the journey, I also realized that in a competitive world, there is always a company that will pay more than what is economically reasonable to “win the market.” One day, with an enormous cost and deteriorating returns, the steamroller will run over you.

In the past, monopolies were often broken up because of their negative effects on consumers in the form of increased pricing or constraining markets. The monopolies today are constructed differently and do the exact opposite for consumers. The consumers win in the form of better pricing and service—which is deflationary— and, therefore, the monopolies are hard to stop. As I learned the hard way, you are either the platform or the arbitrage on the platform. In the long term, there is no in-between.

It is the act of stabilizing an economy through socializing the losses when faced with a collapse that undermines capitalism’s own institutional framework.

should therefore expect more easing, and more chaos from it, as the can is kicked down the road once again.

Systematically preventing forest fires from taking place ‘to be safe’ makes the big one much worse.”16 By continuing to add debt and kick the can down the road, governments and central banks have prevented some of the small fires—in this case, the pain of restructuring.

Put the lagging GDP growth with illusionary asset inflation, plus an impossible-to-maintain rise of debt, against a backdrop of technology growing at an exponential rate, and the phase transition starts to come into focus.

we’re thinking with the same brains that humans have always had, and we still have long-held beliefs and biases.

bias blind spot—when we recognize a bias in others’ decision-making while failing to see it in ourselves—mean we are often not as clever as we believe.

argue as if you were right, but listen as if you were wrong.

The best leaders are constantly learning, curious about where they made mistakes and actively looking for areas where they might have it wrong. Arguing as if you’re right and listening like you’re wrong allows leaders to confidently go forward with a direction, while also being able to course correct when new information arises that suggests a better path.

the best ideas win.

“strong opinions, weakly held.” Strong opinions allow leaders to move forward quickly, which is important because it avoids information and choice overload. “Weakly held” adds the humility to constantly be learning and ready to course correct.

The answer is that piece of paper on fold fifty would stretch from the Earth to the sun: 149 million kilometres.

the cost of one megabyte of hard drive memory has fallen from approximately $1 million in 1967 to 2 cents today.

current forecasts of continually increasing demand for automobiles are very wrong. Instead, automotive production, and the jobs with it, could fall by 50 percent or more as autonomous cars move into the mainstream.

According to a 2015 report, 14 percent of land in Los Angeles County is committed to parking.

A technology that reduces costs so significantly and produces better outcomes is again deflationary in nature and, because of market incentives, impossible to stop.

digital twinning (an exact twin of the physical world that is digital),

And when it comes to trade wars and tariffs, how do governments collect a tax on a digital image that could be uploaded from anywhere and printed perfectly anywhere else? (in regards to manufacturing like 3D printing)

If we are doubling our rate of progress on technology every eighteen months or so, and that technology is deflationary, then it is also logical to expect if it “only” took $185 trillion of debt over the last twenty years to fight the deflation and drive growth, then it might take that number again, but this time over the next thirty-six or so months. And eighteen months after that, a further $370 trillion.

The simple power of technology is that it allows for abundance without the same amount of jobs or income... if we let it. It is a fact that we better get used to if we want that same abundance in our lives.
         
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed and that the total amount of energy in the universe must remain the same.

The second law of thermodynamics states that energy always moves from higher to lower concentrations. In other words, heat dissipates.

As Mark Lewis of BNP Paribas Asset Management wrote, “We conclude that the economics of oil for gasoline and diesel vehicles versus wind- and solar-powered EVs are now in relentless and irreversible decline, with far- reaching implications

flywheel—converts electricity to kinetic energy for storage and then converts kinetic energy back to electricity when needed.

It is also quite possible that vast central energy planning grids may give way to generation that is local and interconnected broadly, in the same way that the Internet is a distributed technology with connected nodes, and this interconnection makes the Internet more reliable and secure. In this case, my home and other homes in my region could be a backup for when others or other regions are using energy, and vice versa.

If electricity was a match, artificial intelligence is the sun.

Another way the brain seems to encode information more quickly is through the deemed importance of the information—how it stands out versus all other information. A strong example of that type of memory is the birth of a child or the death of a loved one.

By the end of 2018 in the twelve regions, the system had already blocked access for 5.4 million people from travelling on high speed trains and an additional 17 million people from taking airline flights.

homogeneity bias, where we believe people in other groups all act the same while our group is more diverse.

It is easy to apply your perspective on how other people “should” act when they are on a different level, instead of asking the question, “How would I act?” If you or your family were dying of starvation, or being persecuted, what would you do differently from what you’re doing now?

n his seminal book Actionable Gamification, Yu-kai Chou proposes a framework called Octalysis. In that framework, Yu-kai believes that there are eight motivational forces that drive every action we take—not just in games, but foundational to everything.

The conjunction of those three things—1) Maslow’s hierarchy, where many in the world or even our own backyard are at very different stages of the pyramid; 2) technology that targets us individually and therefore reinforces belief patterns; and 3) a natural tendency in humans to create “us versus them”—has the potential to create a dangerous reinforcing loop where hate and division reign. Especially if the world is becoming more unequal.

One US dollar in 1914 was equal to 4 German marks; by 1923, the same US dollar was worth 4.2 trillion German marks. Imagine a life’s savings not being enough to purchase a loaf of bread.

In a world where abundance is possible, it is a flawed system that gives rise to extreme inequality.

### Game Theory Stuff

has broad implication in business, economics, biology, and war—whenever our own actions depend critically on other participants.

Always cooperate—No matter what the competitor does. Always betray—No matter what the competitor does. Tit for tat—Cooperate in the beginning and then copy what the opponent did in their last move. Spiteful—Cooperate until an opponent betrays and then always betray. Mistrust—Betray first, then copy opponent’s moves.

An evolutionary bias for cooperation means that although it does not always feel that way, humans acting together in mutual interest should be able to solve our greatest challenges. The cost of not doing so is highest of all: we will likely not survive as a species.

#### How to make betrayal more likely

Based on how others play the game, we are constantly modifying our own strategies, copying those of people we respect and changing our minds about how to play our game based on incentives and penalties. That means that it would be unlikely, in a human game, for a single strategy to win forever. A simple thought experiment shows why. Consider an imaginary world where there was no conflict. Humanity had agreed through mutual reciprocity, trust, and cooperation to abolish all wars. In that imaginary world, society would rid itself of death and destruction from conflict. The prize for all inhabitants would be a world of peace and love. Weapons and the cost of those weapons would no longer be needed. But if a world like that existed, the prize to the power hungry for betrayal would be much higher: a case would be where one country secretly amasses weapons to easily invade and take over all countries because those inhabitants would be unable to defend themselves. And because of that increased payoff, betrayal becomes more likely.

You could expect that if you made a big bet and were wrong, you would be wiped out—but if you were right, your hard work, ingenuity, or risk taking would be rewarded. In game theory, we could call this a dominant cooperative strategy, and it dominated for the better part of the twentieth century. The rise of fiat currencies that could be manipulated domestically and the bailout in 2008 changed that strategy to one where the players whose bad bets caused the crisis, instead of being wiped out, were rewarded handsomely. Capitalism’s long-dominant cooperative strategy was replaced by a non-dominant strategy, crony capitalism, where the cheaters won.

But, really, it is not “them.” The same thing that allows our best and brightest companies to become irrelevant exists in every one of us.

according to Ray Dalio, there are only four levers governments can pull to escape debt crises. The current debt burden is so large that any long-term solution must deal with it, so we will categorize the proposed solutions by how they attempt to use one of the four ways to escape the debt burden: Austerity—spending less Debt defaults/ restructuring The central bank printing money or other guarantees Transfers of money from those who have more than they need to those who have less (much higher taxes for the rich)

As we see in businesses that fail to transition to a new economic reality, it takes bold leadership to do what is needed for the long term, because the short-term pain is too great. But as a by-product of not taking bold action for the long term, the business is forced into bankruptcy later. I call this the kick-the-can-down-the-road strategy —or rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Another way of looking at this strategy is “growth at any cost to society.”

As we have seen throughout this book, this strategy has only one endgame: 1) higher inequality, 2) people losing hope in the system due to not being able to make ends meet, 3) more polarization, 4) a rise of leaders that use the polarization to create “us versus them” narratives to consolidate power, and 5) commonplace revolution and wars. This solution, in the end, is a dissolution.

Just as game theory predicts, we care about our own needs first. Domestic issues always take precedent over international ones, which means a system that is controlled by one nation and is the backbone of all other currencies might work for a time—until the country’s domestic issues force it to unilaterally deliver economic benefit to the nation in control of the currency while hurting all others. Once trust is broken in that exchange, game theory predicts actions by other countries will encourage the growth of their own currencies—and all hell breaks loose because international cooperation is lost.

But in 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated a critical aspect of the system—the conversion of the US dollar to gold—and with that change created a system where the US dollar, a fiat currency subject to domestic agenda, was the backbone of the world’s economic order. From here, Bretton Woods effectively ended.


But even with risk and current high volatility, citizens in some parts of the world have less risk in holding Bitcoin than their own currency. The value can be moved across borders seamlessly or used as a payment mechanism when currency fails. In Venezuela today, for example, Bitcoin is already acting as a lifesaving currency for those who have it, as it is a much more secure payment medium than the local currency.

The inflation rate on the bolívar, Venezuela’s local currency, was 1.8 million percent in 2018. Having the
choice, even in 2018, I would much rather lose 30 per-cent on my Bitcoin than 1.8 million percent on my bolívar.

It is easy to dismiss it out of hand, because we are trapped in a system where we don’t know what we would do with ourselves if we didn’t have jobs. Our careers are far more important to us than just the income that they bring. Our careers become part of the story of who we are—with our relationships and social status (our “us”) often coming from our jobs. For that reason, even if the facts are inescapable, that most of these jobs will be better done by technology, we bury our heads in the sand. The fear of a future without those jobs and self-worth that they bring stops us from imagining a better world in which they might not even be required.

As an entire infrastructure needed to support more jobs to support price inflation resulting from monetary easing is removed, the cost of entitlement programs is removed with it.
