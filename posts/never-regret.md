title: 'Do More of What You Never Regret'

A common phrase is "Live Without Regrets." There's another phrase that goes along the lines of "Play to Win." I feel like these two are at odds with each other.

I would say it's impossible to live without having regrets and trying to do so is strong not playing to win.

What if instead of trying to "live without regrets," we put our energy into doing more things that we have never regretted doing. It's a change from focusing on what you can't control to focusing on what you can.

I've never regretted traveling with friends. So I should schedule trips with friends and work towards making them happen more often.

What are some things in your life that you will probably never regret doing?
