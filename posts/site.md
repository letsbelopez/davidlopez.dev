You can see the code that builds this site on [github](https://github.com/letsbelopez/davidql.com) 

### About the Site

- Hosted on AWS Amplify.
- Built with NextJS static site generation (SSG)

### Long Life and Simplicity

I'd like this site to last longer than I do. To do that the site needs to be dependent on few tools, no companies to operate or maintain anything, and very easy for someone else to update.
