Take these examples: 

If your friend does something annoying or rude, chances are you'll deal with it instead of confronting your friend. If your friend becomes reprehensible, you'll probably stop being friends with them instead of having a difficult
conversation with them to work through the issues.

You're probably unaware of the many rude and annoying things that you are doing to your friends. Chances
are good that they can just deal with it because they're still your friends after all.

Be a better friend than you think you have to be, and try to balance out the bad with
overwhelming good because you'll never know all of the bad that you're doing.
