### About this project

I was a contractor on this project with the Fresh Consulting backend team. The Ikonix IVS app is an Angular web
application connected to a .NET Core API


At this project I acted as the lead UI developer specialist acting as a bridge between design and frontend development
and with the backend team and frontend
development. The main challenge was to create a user friendly dashboard to manage decades of data and streamline user
workflows. This drastically improved the speed to complete user tasks and onboard new users. Ikonix estimated that the
new app will save $450,000 every year.
