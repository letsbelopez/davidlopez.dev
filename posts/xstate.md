title: 'XState 101 - An Introduction to State Machines Using JavaScript'

I didn't think there was good accessible examples using state machines in
software at the time, so I made a course to teach others how to use state machines in a JavaScript app.

The course is designed so it's applicable to state machines in general, but I used a JavaScript library called
[xstate](https://xstate.js.org) to implement the state machine in a react web
app. The good thing about xstate is that it's framework and library agnostic, so
you can use it in any JavaScript app or website.

If you're interested in getting an intro to state machines, I think you'll find value in
it. The first lesson is an overview of state machines and in the second and third lessons we build a state machine
with JavaScript. Please enjoy.
