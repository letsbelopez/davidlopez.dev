<h2>Do More of What You Never Regret</h2>
<p>A common phrase is "Live Without Regrets." There's another phrase that goes along the lines of "Play to Win." I feel like these two are at odds with each other.</p>
<p>I would say it's impossible to live without having regrets and trying to do so is strong not playing to win.</p>
<p>What if instead of trying to "live without regrets," we put our energy into doing more things that we have never regretted doing. It's a change from focusing on what you can't control to focusing on what you can.</p>
<p>I've never regretted traveling with friends. So I should schedule trips with friends and work towards making them happen more often.</p>
<p>What are some things in your life that you will probably never regret doing?</p>
