<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  I like to spend most of my time working on software projects that will be useful to others.
  That's where I get a lot of energy from. So it feels indulgent spending time working on my own website all about me.
  Even though it is fun.
  And doubly indulgent to have a whole page dedicated to myself.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully it's useful for those of you who want to know more about me, or potentially work with me on a project.

    was that bad. This is my first experience with tech documentation</li>
  <li>2008: formed a business to sell coffee equipment, and launched the <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080913030523/http://www.poshportage.com/">first version of the website</a>
    called Posh Portage</li>
