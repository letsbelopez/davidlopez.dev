<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>You can see the code that builds this site on <a href="https://github.com/letsbelopez/davidlopez.dev">github</a></p>
<p>
  Some parts of this site are plain on purpose. It reflects my desire to only have what's needed. Some parts of the site will be dedicated to coding, and front end experiments. Some of those won't be 'plain.'

<h3>Long Life</h3>
<p>
  I'd like this site to last longer than I do. To do that the site needs to be dependent on few tools and no companies to
  operate or maintain anything.
</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>
  If I have to maintain a website, I might as well make it as easy as possible for myself. When the site starts up, a JS script goes through some directories of plain text files and build the routes and puts the content in a Pug template. All I have to do to update the site is edit plain text files!
