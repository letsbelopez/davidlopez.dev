<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>
  My goal for this site is to reflect my personal coding style. Below are some principles I have for
  myself.
</p>
<h3>Long Life</h3>
<p>
  My goal with this website is that will last longer than me. I'm doing that by running a plain
  Express server with plain text files. This site is dependent on few tools and no companies to
  operate or maintain anything.
</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>
  If you got to maintain a website, I might as well make it as easy as possible for myself. It's
  easier for me to just update text files on my computer. It's also a pleasure to just have what is
  needed.
