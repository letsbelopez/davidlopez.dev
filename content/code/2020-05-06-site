<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>You can see the code that builds this site on <a href="https://github.com/letsbelopez/davidlopez.dev">github</a>.</p>
<p>
  Most of this site is plain on purpose. It reflects my desire to only have what's needed. Some parts will be dedicated to coding experiments, which may not be as plain.
</p>
<h3>About the Site</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hosted on Digital Ocean. I set up an Ubuntu Virtual Machine and manage everything through SSH</li>
  <li>Configuring Nginx with Let's Encrypt automated SSL/TLS cert renewal</li>
  <li>Built a static site generator to compile my HTML (that's the github link)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Long Life and Simplicity</h3>
<p>
  I'd like this site to last longer than I do. To do that the site needs to be dependent on few tools, no companies to
  operate or maintain anything, and very easy for someone else to update.
