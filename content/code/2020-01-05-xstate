<h2>Sate Machines in JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  I listen to a podcast called <a href="https://syntax.fm">syntax fm</a> sometimes. It's mostly
  about web development. One of the hosts mentioned something about state machines and it sounded
  interesting so I looked into it. I didn't think there was much information about using them in
  software at the time, so I made a small tutorial series on the topic. I tried to make it so it's
  applicable to State Machines in general, but I used a JavaScript library called
  <a href="https://xstate.js.org">xstate</a> to implement the state machine in a react web
  application. The good thing about xstate though is that it's framework and library agnostic, so
  you can use it in any JavaScript app or website.

  If you're interested in getting an intro to state machines, I think you'll find some value out of
  it. So please enjoy.
