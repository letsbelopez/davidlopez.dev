<h2>XState 101 - An Introduction to State Machines Using JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  I didn't think there was good accessible examples using state machines in
  software at the time, so I made a course to teach others how to use state machines in a JavaScript app.
</p>
<p>
  The course is designed so it's applicable to state machines in general, but I used a JavaScript library called
  <a href="https://xstate.js.org">xstate</a> to implement the state machine in a react web
  app. The good thing about xstate is that it's framework and library agnostic, so
  you can use it in any JavaScript app or website.
</p>
<p>
  If you're interested in getting an intro to state machines, I think you'll find value in
  it. The first lesson is an overview of state machines and in the second and third lessons we build a state machine
  with JavaScript. Please enjoy.
