<h2>SynctUp Mobile App</h2>
<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>
  Project was developed as a contractor with one other developer from the Fresh Consulting team.
  SynctUp is an Angular app running on the Ionic Capacitor mobile app framework. It was built for iOS and
  Android.
</p>
<p>
  On this project I was a full stack developer. The main challenge was to redesign the backend architecture and
  database.
  We increased code maintainability and scalibility while reducing the overall code footprint. Part of this project was
  delivering
  visual documentation of the sytem architecture.
