<h2>Ikonix USA IVS Enterprise App</h2>
<p>
  One of Ikonix's businesses is electrical instrument calibration and testing. Their technicians have been using a Windows desktop app to record test data and generate calibration certificates for the past 20 years. The new UI was built by me using Angular 7. The full app upgrade is estimated to save Ikonix $450,000 every year because of time saved using the app and onboarding new technicians.
