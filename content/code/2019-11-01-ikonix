<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>
  I was a contractor on this project with the Fresh Consulting backend team. The Ikonix IVS app is an Angular web
  application connected to a .NET Core API
</p>
<p>
  At this project I acted as the lead UI developer specialist acting as a bridge between design and frontend development
  and with the backend team and frontend
  development. The main challenge was to create a user friendly dashboard to manage decades of data and streamline user
  workflows. This drastically improved the speed to complete user tasks and onboard new users. Ikonix estimated that the
  new app will save $450,000 every year.
